# Faceclaw input tokens and CLI

In **Settings → API Keys → Input tokens**, choose **Create token**, give it a
name, select its permissions, and choose **Generate token**. Copy or save the
secret before leaving the result menu: Faceclaw stores only its SHA-256 hash.
Select an existing token to change permissions or revoke it. A token with no
permissions is disabled. Up to 32 tokens can exist at once.

Permissions are independent:

- **Provide input** simulates watch or ring gestures, including navigation,
  taps and the system menu. It has the same reach as those input devices.
- **Text to foreground window** delivers text to the selected app's text input.
- **Text to voice assistant** submits a query to the configured assistant.
- **Capture the screen** returns the composited glasses screen as a PNG. It
  shows whatever the wearer sees, notifications included, so grant it only to
  callers that should see that.

While the glasses are locked, only gestures and `ping` are accepted. Gestures
pass through the existing lock-screen and sleep behavior. The assistant must be
configured; the selected window must accept text. Android requires connected
glasses; iOS also allows the active phone preview. An assistant acknowledgment
means the query was submitted, not that the assistant has finished answering.

## Connect

While at least one token exists, Faceclaw listens on **127.0.0.1:8791** and,
by default, detected **Tailscale addresses**. It never binds a wildcard or a
Wi-Fi/LAN address. Under **Input tokens → Listening interfaces**, choose:

- **Localhost + Tailscale (auto)**: detect a named Tailscale tunnel or a tunnel
  with Tailscale's dedicated IPv6 prefix; bind its tailnet IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
- **Localhost / USB only**: disable remote network access.
- A specific **tunnel interface** (such as `tun0` or `utun3`): use this when
  automatic identification is unavailable, including IPv4-only VPN setups.

Automatic detection uses the prefixes in [Tailscale's address documentation](https://tailscale.com/docs/concepts/ip-and-dns-addresses).
A CGNAT IPv4 address by itself is not sufficient to identify Tailscale. The
interface picker shows names and addresses of tunnel interfaces; choose the
one belonging to Tailscale. Physical Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and cellular interfaces
are excluded. Interface selection is saved; addresses are refreshed every
three seconds after a tunnel connects, disconnects, or changes address.
Localhost remains available even when the selected tunnel is absent.

**Connection information** shows the actual listening addresses. From a
computer on your tailnet, pass the phone's displayed Tailscale address:

```sh
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs --host 100.x.y.z interactive
```

Apps on the same phone can connect directly to localhost. From a computer,
you can also forward the port over USB:

```sh
# Android (ADB must already be paired/authorized)
adb forward tcp:8791 tcp:8791

# iOS, using libimobiledevice's iproxy with a trusted, connected phone
iproxy 8791 8791
```

Keep Faceclaw running; iOS
can suspend it when backgrounded without an active glasses session. Revoking
the last token stops the listener.

## Command-line utility

The utility requires Node.js 18+. Run `npm install` in this checkout to install
its [Enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) text editor, then run the
CLI below. For use on another computer, copy both `faceclaw-input.cjs` and
`faceclaw-input-editor.cjs` into one directory and run
`npm install enquirer@2.4.1` there. One-off commands do not load the editor.

```sh
export FACECLAW_TOKEN='fc1_…'  # Paste the generated token
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs input tap
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs input up
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs input scroll-down --source ring
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs text 'Text for the foreground app'
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs text -n 'Type without pressing Enter'
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs assistant 'What is on my calendar?'
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs screenshot --out screen.png
node scripts/faceclaw-input.cjs interactive
```

`npm run input -- …` is also available. Use `--token-file FILE` instead of the
environment variable to read a token from a file. `--host` and `--port` (or
`FACECLAW_HOST` and `FACECLAW_PORT`) select a forwarded endpoint. Messages
starting with `--` can follow an option terminator, e.g. `text -- '--help'`.
For terminal windows, text normally appends Enter; `text -n` suppresses that
submission, like `echo -n`. Embedded newlines in the message are preserved.
Other apps receive the text unchanged. Assistant messages do not accept `-n`.
`screenshot` saves the glasses screen as a 4-bit grayscale PNG to `--out FILE`,
or writes it to standard output when that is redirected; it refuses to write
image data to a terminal. The image is the full 640x480 screen, not cropped to
the occupied area the phone's screenshot button saves, so successive captures
line up. Nothing is written to the phone's storage.
One-off commands return a nonzero exit code on rejection or connection failure.
The CLI never automatically replays an input or message after a failure,
since delivery may already have occurred.

Interactive mode connects and authenticates immediately, without waiting for a
keypress. It validates the token using a side-effect-free `ping`, then checks
connectivity periodically while idle. Each action checks its own permission,
so a token with only text or assistant permission can also use composition. If a request fails, it reports
the error, drops queued keys, and keeps trying to reconnect until Ctrl-C.
It never replays a possibly-delivered gesture. Each request uses a fresh socket,
kept open until the reply arrives (including when using USB forwarding).
Update the phone app alongside the CLI so it supports `ping`.

Interactive mode maps arrow keys to watch directions, Enter to tap, Esc to
double-tap, and Tab to a complete long-press (press and release). Ctrl-C exits
and restores terminal settings. Esc uses a short disambiguation delay to tell
it apart from arrow-key escape sequences. Events are serialized, with a bounded
queue to prevent excessive key-repeat lag.

### Compose text or an assistant message

From interactive controls, press **i** to compose text for the foreground
window, or **a** to compose a message for the assistant. A labeled Enquirer
prompt replaces the gesture controls until you finish:

- **Enter** sends the draft once and returns to controls. Foreground text uses
  the normal submission behavior, including Enter in terminal windows.
- **Esc** discards and clears the draft, then returns to controls.
- **Ctrl-C** discards the draft and quits the utility.

While composing, arrows edit the line; Tab, Enter and Esc never send watch
gestures. The letters `i` and `a` are ordinary text. The editor supports
Left/Right, Home/End, Backspace/Delete, Ctrl-A/E (start/end), Ctrl-W (delete the
previous word), and Ctrl-K (delete to the end). Input is a single line, with
an 8000-character limit; an empty draft sends nothing. Every new draft starts
empty, and no message history is stored. Connection-status output is deferred
while the editor is visible so it cannot corrupt the prompt.

The token needs **Text to foreground window** for `i` and **Text to voice
assistant** for `a`. A permission rejection is reported and returns to controls;
it does not end the interactive session or resend the message.

## Protocol for other apps

Open a TCP connection, send one UTF-8 JSON object terminated by a newline, and
read a newline-terminated JSON reply. Each connection carries one request.
Authentication and current permissions are checked for every request.

```json
{"version":1,"token":"fc1_…","action":"input","gesture":"click","source":"watch"}
{"version":1,"token":"fc1_…","action":"text","text":"hello","submit":false}
{"version":1,"token":"fc1_…","action":"ping","permission":"input"}
{"version":1,"token":"fc1_…","action":"assistant","text":"Hello"}
{"version":1,"token":"fc1_…","action":"screenshot"}
```

Input gestures: `click`, `double-click`, `long-press`, `short-then-long-press`,
`scroll-up`, `scroll-down`, `swipe-up`, `swipe-down`, `swipe-left`, `swipe-right`.
Source defaults to `watch`; `ring` supports all except the four swipes.
The CLI also accepts `tap`, `double-tap`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` aliases.

`submit` is an optional boolean for `text`, defaulting to `true`; `false`
suppresses the terminal app's appended Enter. `ping` validates the token and,
if supplied, the requested `permission`, without dispatching any input or
requiring connected glasses.

Successful reply: `{"ok":true}`. A `screenshot` reply adds `png`, the
composited screen as a base64-encoded 4-bit grayscale PNG; `unavailable` means
nothing has been drawn yet. It is usually a few KiB, but can approach 200 KiB
for a screen that does not compress. Rejections contain `ok:false`, `error`, and
`message`. Error codes: `bad_request`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `locked`,
`unavailable`, `failed`, `timeout`. Malformed framing closes the connection.
Request frames are limited to 64 KiB; text to 8000 JavaScript UTF-16 code units and
must contain non-whitespace text without NUL. Whitespace in valid text is preserved.
Connections have a five-second read deadline and five-second dispatch deadline.
Each listening address serves one connection at a time with a bounded socket backlog.
Token values and request text are never written to the server log.
