/**
 * A minimal, stock-firmware-compatible flow used only to show the pre-flash confirmation
 * prompt on the glasses and read back the user's Yes/No choice. It speaks only the stock subset
 * — session prelude, a text container, a list container, and heartbeats. No images.
 *
 * Both arms are connected and security-authenticated up front, even though the prompt itself
 * only needs the right arm (the lenses relay messages to each other, and acks/events only ever
 * come from the right arm): on an unbonded phone the auth exchange is what raises the OS
 * pairing prompt, and doing both here means both prompts appear at the start rather than one
 * popping up half way through flashing the second lens. While connected, each arm's battery
 * level is read (they are independent batteries) so the caller can refuse to flash on a low
 * charge. Before the prompt is shown, the right arm's settings are read once more so a lens
 * that reports silent mode (which blanks the display and ignores input) is refused with the
 * way out instead of a prompt nobody can see.
 *
 * With `skipPrompt` the on-glasses confirmation is not shown: the flow is just connect + auth +
 * battery read + result(approved). Used to re-check the battery after the user has already
 * confirmed once. [run] executes on the caller's worker thread; the heartbeat runs on its own
 * thread while the prompt is up.
