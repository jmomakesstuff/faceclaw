/**
 * Hands bytes to a Java `java.nio.ByteBuffer` parameter without leaking them.
 *
 * Why this exists: NativeScript Android (9.0.4 through at least 9.1.1)
 * converts a JS ArrayBuffer or typed array passed to a Java method by wrapping
 * its backing store in `NewDirectByteBuffer` and taking a JNI global ref that is
 * never deleted (JsArgConverter.cpp, `buffer = env.NewGlobalRef(buffer)`). The
 * ByteBuffer is also linked to the JS ArrayBuffer as its native counterpart.
 * The leaked global ref keeps the ByteBuffer reachable forever, so the
 * runtime's GC handshake (Runtime.makeInstanceWeakAndCheckIfAlive) always says
 * "alive", the JS finalizer re-arms, and V8 never frees the ArrayBuffer. Every
 * call leaked its whole buffer plus one global ref.
 *
 * On the frame path that meant a full surface (576x260, 640x452 or 640x480
 * bytes) per submitted frame, including frames the Java side then discards as
 * unchanged. Measured on a Galaxy Z Fold7, native-heap growth matched frame
 * bytes submitted to within a few percent, and Samsung's Heimdall memory
 * manager killed the app at about 6.4 GB. ART also aborts the process once
 * 51,200 global refs are held, so the ref leak is a second ceiling behind the
 * memory one.
 *
 * The workaround keeps the conversion out of the call: the bytes are copied
 * into a Java-allocated direct ByteBuffer that is reused, through an
 * ArrayBuffer view made once with `ArrayBuffer.from` (an external backing
 * store over the Java memory, no global ref), and the Java ByteBuffer object
 * itself is passed. A JS proxy for an existing Java object takes the ordinary
 * object path, which does not leak.
 *
 * Contract: the buffer returned by load() is only valid until the next load()
 * on the same instance, so the Java callee must consume it synchronously and
 * not keep a reference. The Kotlin consumers (SurfaceCompositor via
 * AndroidByteReader, playBuzzerSequence, ShellScene.decode) copy or parse
 * before returning, which satisfies this. One instance belongs to one JS
 * context (main thread or one worker); instances are not shared across
 * isolates.
